## Description
This presentation will run you through the process and the tools for you to create a custom toolbar with a set of custom tools thanks to pyRevit, some python coding or a dynamo script. The idea is to empower advanced users of Revit and help them structure a toolbox to improve their productivity and get rid of the repetitive or tedious tasks.
• First part will cover the structure of pyRevit Framework, its capabilities, and its set of tools
• Second part will be about creating a simple toolbar
• Third part about the creation of a few scripts to populate our toolbar
• Finally, to show a way to distribute the toolbar across an organization
